Possible Bacons (First/Last 5)

Your program should help you find other possible Bacons, according to two different criteria:
- Degree (number of costars). This is the same as in the short assignment.

BEST - These actors have a high number of edges leading in to them.
Robert De Niro
Gene Hackman
Michael Caine
Sean Connery
Harvey Keitel

WORST - These actors have a low number of edges leading in to them.
Patrick Achdjian
Polli Magaro
Gigi Leung
Michel Simon
Joshua Suherman

- Average separation (path length) when serving as center of the universe. This simply requires looping over all the
actors one by one. Consider each one as the center of the universe, find the average path length using the method above,
and store it away for sorting. So just a few lines of code. It could take some time, but under a minute on my machine
with the sample solution. Since not all actors are in the Bacon universe (have a path to him), you can limit the
result to those that are.

BEST - These actors have a low average separation.
[Gene Hackman, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Sean Connery, Michael Caine]

WORST - These actors have a high average separation.
[Nita Naldi, John Longden, Charles Paton, John F. Hamilton, Sara Allgood]
